# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
 The scope of this analysis was to help Louise determine the successes of multiple campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

Based on this analysis we were able to provide, she can use the results to help drive more successful campaigns in the future.
