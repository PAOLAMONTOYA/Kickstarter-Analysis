# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
 The scope of this analysis was to help Louise determine the successes of multiple campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. By breaking down a large data set of over 4,000 crowdfunding projects, using statistical analysis, we were able to help Louise draw conclusions on which campaigns were deemed successful, failed or canceled. Based on this analysis we were able to provide, she can use the results to help drive more successful campaigns in the future.

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickestater data contained a little over 4,000 projects with over 40 different categories that were connected to a subcategory. By using text to columns, I was able to cut the data in half and focus on Theatre campains - more specifically, the plays.

To determine the number of succesful, failed and canceled campaigns based on their goal, I used the =COUNTIF statements which brough me the total amount of campaigns per column for each goal. Following, I was able to determine the percentage of each one which was then turned into a visual represenation to see the trends. My analysis of data can be found in my [repository](https://github.com/PAOLAMONTOYA/Kickstarter-Analysis). 

Challenges I had are realted to Git hub. This a program I've never used before. Uploading folders was a little challenging as well as unerstanding the difference between all of the pages/controls you have:
- Committing to main branch?
- new repository? 
- using brackets to access the links
By using the [Git Hub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code), I was able to find most of my answers as well as refering to the Module pages for assistance. 

## Results
#### Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Dates
The most successful campaigns began trending upward in the spring and coming to it's peak in the summer months: April through August. The month of May had the most success because of its ratio of Successful to Fail was 2:1 with a low percentage of cancelled. <img width="576" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-28 at 10 59 06 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88811084/131223700-904e2296-f625-497d-8ee8-9dfab4ecedd4.png">

#### Outcomes based on Goals
I would suggest not having a goal of minimum 9,999 in order have the most successful outcomes. When the goal began increased passed 9,999, the data become more consistent with having 1 thing in common: increased number of failed and decreased number of successful.

### Limitations of the Data
To get a better understanding of the who Louise's customers are would be more hepful to her and the analysis. If we understood the age groups that atteneded more during peak times, we might understand why there are cancellations other months and the budget the aduience typically has.

## Tables or Graphs
I would add a Primary and Secondary axis to the Theatre Outcomes based on Launch Dates graph. I would include the Primary as total projects and create a secondary for Successful, Failed and Cancelled in each graph to see the trend of more projects created and the outcomes.
